\title{Calculate conditional sample mean/SEs}
\usage{
calc_cmean(DT, y, x, se = FALSE, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{DT}{a data.table}

\item{y}{a character vector of column names of DT to calculate the group mean
of}

\item{x}{a character vector of columns in DT to group by}

\item{se}{logical, if TRUE output will calculate standard error and confidence
 intervals of mean alng with  number of observations of conditional sample
mean}

\item{alpha}{a real number between 0 and 1, to use as the alpha level in
confidence interval construction (default is .05)}
}
\value{
The data.table of conditional sample means
}
\description{
calc_cmean() is a function that calculates sample means (plus
 standard errors and confidence intervals) by group.
}
\examples{
DT <- data.table(x1 = sample(1:5, 1000, replace = T),
                 x2 = sample(1:2, 1000, replace = T)) \%>\%
      .[, y := 2*x1 + 4*x2 + rnorm(mean = 10, sd = 4, n = 1000)]

calc_cmean(DT, y = c("y"), x = c("x1", "x2"))
